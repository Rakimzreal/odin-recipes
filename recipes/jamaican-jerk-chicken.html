    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Jamaican jerk chicken is a dish rich in cultural heritage and packed with bold, spicy flavor. The recipe centers on a traditional jerk marinade made with Scotch bonnet peppers, allspice, thyme, garlic, ginger, and other spices, often blended with citrus juice and soy sauce. Chicken is marinated for several hours—or even overnight—to deeply infuse the meat with the signature smoky-sweet heat. Grilling over an open flame or coals is the traditional cooking method, lending the chicken its iconic charred edges and savory depth.</p>

    <p>Once cooked, jerk chicken boasts a dark, caramelized crust and juicy, tender interior bursting with layers of flavor. Its typically served alongside classic Jamaican sides like rice and peas, fried plantains, or steamed vegetables, creating a hearty and satisfying plate. The heat from the peppers is balanced by the warmth of spices like cinnamon and nutmeg, making every bite complex and deeply aromatic. Whether enjoyed from a street vendor or homemade, jerk chicken delivers an unforgettable taste of the Caribbean.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into chunks</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>4 limes, juiced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground allspice</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dreid thyme</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon grinded ginger</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>2 onions, chopped</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups chopped green onions</li>
            <li>2 habanero peppers, chopped</li>
            <li>6 cloved garlics, chopped</li>
            </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chicken in a medium bowl. Cover with water and lime juice. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Place oil, allspice, thyme, black pepper, salt, brown sugar, ginger, and nutmeg in a blender; blend until well combined. Add onions, green onions, habanero peppers, and garlic; blend until almost smooth.</li>
            <li>Pour most of the blended marinade mixture into the bowl with chicken, reserving a small amount to use as a basting sauce while cooking. Stir chicken until well coated. Cover the bowl and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Cook chicken slowly on the preheated grill, turning frequently and basting often with reserved marinade mixture, until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
