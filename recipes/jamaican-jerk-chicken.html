    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Jamaican jerk chicken is a dish rich in cultural heritage and packed with bold, spicy flavor. The recipe centers on a traditional jerk marinade made with Scotch bonnet peppers, allspice, thyme, garlic, ginger, and other spices, often blended with citrus juice and soy sauce. Chicken is marinated for several hours—or even overnight—to deeply infuse the meat with the signature smoky-sweet heat. Grilling over an open flame or coals is the traditional cooking method, lending the chicken its iconic charred edges and savory depth.</p>

    <p>Once cooked, jerk chicken boasts a dark, caramelized crust and juicy, tender interior bursting with layers of flavor. Its typically served alongside classic Jamaican sides like rice and peas, fried plantains, or steamed vegetables, creating a hearty and satisfying plate. The heat from the peppers is balanced by the warmth of spices like cinnamon and nutmeg, making every bite complex and deeply aromatic. Whether enjoyed from a street vendor or homemade, jerk chicken delivers an unforgettable taste of the Caribbean.</p>
