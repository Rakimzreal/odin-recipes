    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Bistro-style steak is a simple yet elegant dish inspired by the casual eateries of France. It typically features a tender cut of beef like sirloin, ribeye, or flank steak, seasoned generously with salt and pepper, then seared to perfection for a caramelized crust and juicy interior. Often served medium-rare, the steak is paired with a rich pan sauce—such as a red wine reduction or peppercorn sauce—and accompanied by classic sides like crispy fries, sautéed greens, or a fresh salad, making it a well-balanced and satisfying meal.</p>

    <p>Bistro-style steak is a classic dish inspired by the unfussy yet elegant cuisine served in French cafés and neighborhood restaurants. It usually features a flavorful, tender cut of beef such as sirloin, ribeye, or flank steak, seasoned simply with salt, pepper, and sometimes fresh herbs. The steak is seared in a hot pan or on a grill to develop a caramelized, golden-brown crust while keeping the inside juicy and cooked to your preferred level of doneness—often medium-rare in true bistro fashion.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (14-ounce) New York strip steak</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon melted clarified butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced shallots</li>
            <li>1/3 cup white wine</li>

            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place hash browns in a medium bowl. Melt 5 tablespoons butter and pour over hash browns, season with seasoning salt or garlic powder as desired. Add 1 egg, mix well and press mixture onto the bottom and sides of a 9-inch spring form pan or pie dish.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until potatoes are golden brown and crispy around the edges, about 25 to 30 minutes. </li>
