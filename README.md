# odin-recipes

This is a simple HTML project for The Odin Project.
I will be building a basic recipe website using only HTML to practice : 

- Boilerplates/ structure
-links and images
-tags and elements 


This would help refresh my memory and give a better understanding on HTMl struvture and page nav.
